        <br>As a part of ‘The /now Page’ movement inspired by Derek Sivers, 
        This page shares what I’m working on at the moment and other current stuff. 
        There is a dedicated website where people share what are they up to NOW. 
        Check it out at <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank">NowNowNow.com</a>
